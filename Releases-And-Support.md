# Releases

Xenon is under active development, and new versions are released regularly. Releases can be found on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/vmware/xenon/releases), and artifacts can be found on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vmware/xenon/) and [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/vmware/xenon/). Release numbers follow [Semantic Versioning][semver]. For more information on the release process, see the [Cutting a Release](Cutting-a-release) page.

Since the framework is still fairly early in its lifecycle, releases come at a fast cadence -- we aim to release once every two weeks, with specific point releases sometimes more frequent than that. Each release is subject to the same set of test and reliability requirements imposed by the Xenon [CI environment](Developer-Guide#ci--cd). For more information on the test requirements for each release, see the [Testing](Developer-Guide#testing) section of the developer guide.

## Releases

### v1.3.3

Xenon 1.3.3 contains bug fixes.

For a full description of the changes in this release, please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/vmware/xenon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#133).

### v1.3.2

Xenon 1.3.2 contains performance enhancements and bug fixes.

For a full description of the changes in this release, please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/vmware/xenon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#132).

### v1.3.1

Xenon 1.3.1 contains new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. Notably, this change adds support for delegating authentication to an external service.

For a full description of the changes in this release, please consult the [changelog](https://github.com/vmware/xenon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#131).

#### Major Changes

* **Delegated authentication** -- this release adds support for redirection of un-authenticated API requests to an external service for authentication, as well as verification of access tokens generated by such a service. For full documentation, see the [external authentication](External-Authentication) page.

* **Sort by multiple fields** -- this release adds support for queries to specify multiple fields to use when sorting results. For full documentation, see the [query task service](QueryTaskService#sorting-results) page.

#### Breaking Changes

* **Removal of OperationOption.SEND_WITH_CALLBACK** -- SEND_WITH_CALLBACK was an experimental protocol which allowed the re-use of an HTTP connection for multiple requests. This functionality has largely been supplanted by HTTP/2 in Xenon with the caveat that HTTP/2 does not currently support TLS; this is forthcoming in a subsequent release.
