# Releases

Xenon is under active development, and new versions are released regularly. Releases can be found on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/vmware/xenon/releases), and artifacts can be found on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vmware/xenon/) and [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/vmware/xenon/). Release numbers follow [Semantic Versioning][semver]. For more information on the release process, see the [Cutting a Release](Cutting-a-release) page.

Since the framework is still fairly early in its lifecycle, releases come at a fast cadence -- we aim to release once every two weeks, with specific point releases sometimes more frequent than that. Each release is subject to the same set of test and reliability requirements imposed by the Xenon [CI environment](Developer-Guide#ci--cd). For more information on the test requirements for each release, see the [Testing](Developer-Guide#testing) section of the developer guide.
