# Overview

This page gives you an introduction to querying services. This is a fundamental concept used throughout Xenon. For example, authorization in Xenon is based on queries. 

This tutorial assumes that you have gone through the introductory [Example Service Tutorial](Example-Service-Tutorial). There is an in-depth [Query Task Tutorial](./QueryTaskService) that will give you more extensive detail, including making queries in Java. 

This tutorial assumes you have installed Xenon and can run it from the command-line.
