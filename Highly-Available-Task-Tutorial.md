# Overview
This tutorial covers topics relating to multi node deployments, and the concepts behind high availability, leader election, and service restart during node group changes. It demonstrates the ease of developing robust, scale out workflows, modeled as task services, and the service options, best practices needed.

# Prerequisites

While replicated services deployed across multiple nodes should be the default type of service, this is an advanced topic since it requires some understanding of distributed system concepts, and the xenon programming model. Please make sure to read the tutorials below and *their* prerequisites
