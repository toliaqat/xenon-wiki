# DCP

## What is it?

DCP  is both  a set  of  software components  and a  design pattern.  It
enables the creation  of orchestration in the form  of cooperating light
weight services across  many nodes. The implementation  enables a common
model for  persistence, indexing, querying, concurrency,  scale-out, and
interaction through a restricted set  of primitives (HTTP verbs), and an
observable, dynamic state model. This fabric  is also referred to as the
**Decentralized Control Plane** (DCP).

## What is it for?

An  intermediate goal  is accelerating  various VMware  product efforts,
that require  a decentralized control  plane. The design and  code helps
developers  deliver functionality  as  a service  and/or shrink  wrapped
software.  We  believe  a  shared control  plane  implementation  allows
developers to focus on their specific functionality.
